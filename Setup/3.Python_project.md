# Project setup

To create the project set up, for this lets create a folder where our project will go:
`
mkdir tutorial
`

Move to the project:
`
cd tutorial
`

A new git repository is created locally that allows file versioning
`
git init.
`

Create a virtual enviroment which is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. 
`
python3 -m .venv venv
`

Activate the virtual enviroment
`
source env/bin/activate
`

create a file called requirements.txt where inside we will put what we need for our project
`
requirements.txt
`

`
install dependencies with pip install
`
