# Start using interpreter

Open a command line interface. 
To check the recently installed python version use the following command:
`
python3 --version
`
Python have an interactive mode called REPL where the computer does four things:

__R: Read__ the user input (your Python commandsRead the user input (your Python commandsr)
__E: Evaluate__ your code (to work out what you mean)
__P: Print__ any results (so you can see the computer’s response)
__L: Loop__ back to step 1 (to continue the conversation)

In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number

## See it in practice

First in the command line type `python3` to execute python interactive mode, you should see an output similar to:

`$ python3
Python 3.10.6 (main, Nov 14 2022, 16:10:14) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
`

To sum of the literal integer value `2` with the literal integer value `2` try the following, press enter at the end of each line:
`
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 
`

In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable`_` . Is a simpler way to continue with calculations. In practice it would look like this:
`
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 2 + _
6
>>> 
`

### Another example

The print() function displays a message on the screen. In this example, it’ll show the message "Hello, Word!".

>>> print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
>>> 

## Python Scripts

Create a file named *hello_world.py,* inside it write the following code:

`
print("Hello, World!")
`

Then in the command line:

`
python3 hello_world.py
`
