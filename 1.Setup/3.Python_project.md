# Python project setup

There are several ways to create a working project to write your programs using Python, here let's focus on the more standard and out-of-the-box experience.

This project is, no surprise, a "Hello, World!" but with a twist.

First create a folder where our project will go:

`
$ mkdir tutorial
`

Move to the project:

`
$ cd tutorial
`

(Optional but recommended) Create a git repository, that will allow project files versioning:

`
git init .
`

Working with different projects in your computer is common, some times different versions of Python or projects dependencies are needed across the different projects. To avoid conflicts between the project's Python or dependencies, it is a good practice to "isolate" the Python environment using a "virtual environment". A common way to create a virtual environment is as follows:
(If you get an error try installing virtualenv python module as follow: `pip install virtualenv`)

__For linux__

`
virtualenv .venv
`

__For windows__

`
pyton -m virtualenv .venv
`

Activate the virtual enviroment

__For linux__

`
source env/bin/activate
`

__For windows__

`
.venv\Scripts\activate
`

Create a file called _requirements.txt_ to contain the list of the dependencies needed for this project:

`
pyfiglet
termcolor
colorama
`

Install the dependencies using pip, using the following command:

__For linux__

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

__For windows__

`
.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
`

Then create a file named *hello_world.py* and copy and paste the following code into it:

```
import sys

from colorama import init
init(strip=not sys.stdout.isatty()) # strip colors if stdout is redirected
from termcolor import cprint
from pyfiglet import figlet_format

cprint(figlet_format('Hello, World!', font='starwars'),
       'white', 'on_blue', attrs=['bold'])
```

To run your Python program use the following command:

__For linux__

`
python hello_world.py
`

__For windows__

`
.venv\Scripts\python.exe hello_world.py
`
