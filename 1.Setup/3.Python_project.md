# Project setup

To create the project set up, for this lets create a folder where our project will go:
`
mkdir tutorial
`

Move to the project:
`
cd tutorial
`

A new git repository is created locally that allows file versioning
`
git init.
`

Create a virtual enviroment which is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. 
`
python3 -m .venv venv
`

Activate the virtual enviroment
`
source env/bin/activate
`

Create a file called _requirements.txt_ where inside we are going to put the dependencies that we need for our project, in this case:
`
pyfiglet
termcolor
colorama
`

Install the dependencies using pip, using the following command:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Then create a file named *hello_world.py* and copy and paste the following code into it:
`
import sys

from colorama import init
init(strip=not sys.stdout.isatty()) # strip colors if stdout is redirected
from termcolor import cprint 
from pyfiglet import figlet_format

cprint(figlet_format('Hello, World!', font='starwars'),
       'white', 'on_blue', attrs=['bold'])
`
Then in the command line:

`
python3 hello_world.py
`
